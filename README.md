Database Management Systems (DBMS) play a crucial role in modern data handling by ensuring efficient storage, management, and retrieval of information. Within the real estate and property management sectors, there is a growing need for well-structured systems to manage vast amounts of data related to tenants, leases, payments, maintenance, parking, and staff. Traditional, manual methods of apartment management are often prone to data inconsistencies, redundancy, and operational inefficiencies, which hinder timely decision-making and service quality. Consequently, there is a strong need for an integrated database solution to address these challenges.

The Apartment Management System project aims to create a comprehensive, relational database that streamlines various aspects of property management within a residential complex. This system is specifically designed to achieve Fourth Normal Form (4NF), which reduces multi-valued dependencies and ensures that each table represents a unique entity, resulting in a highly organized and efficient schema.

One of the standout features of this system is the use of triggers to automate critical processes, such as updating lease statuses when end dates are reached. This ensures that the system stays up to date with minimal manual intervention, making it highly reliable and user-friendly. 

A front-end interface built with HTML and CSS facilitates basic operations like adding, updating, and deleting records, providing users with a straightforward way to interact with the database.
